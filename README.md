# ODSharp

A C# implementation of the [fibre](https://github.com/samuelsadok/fibre) protocol for communicating with [ODrive](https://odriverobotics.com/) BLDC motor controllers.

I created this for my own amusement and haven't used it in a real application yet. I have only tested it briefly with an ODrive Pro v4.4 with firmware version 0.6.2, devel branch commit hash 470D1DAC. Seems to work.
